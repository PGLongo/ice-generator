## [0.3.0](https://github.com/PGLongo/ice-generator/compare/v0.1.5...v0.3.0) (2025-12-10)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Complete rebrand from SmICE to CareCard

- Update package name from 'smice' to 'carecard'
- Rebrand all documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Update translations (en.json, it.json) with new name
- Update AppLogo component with new branding
- Change subtitle from 'ICE + NFC + QR + Tags' to 'Your digital emergency card'
- Set version to 0.2.0 for major rebrand milestone

concept while avoiding potential confusion with immigration services.

All functionality remains identical - only branding has changed.
